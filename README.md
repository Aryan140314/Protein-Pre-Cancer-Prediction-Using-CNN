🔍 Overview

      This project presents a deep learning framework to predict whether a protein is cancer-associated based solely on its 3D structural information. Instead of relying on protein sequences or handcrafted biological features, the system converts protein structures into RGB biophysical images and classifies them using  an ensemble of convolutional neural networks.

🎯 Motivation

      Most traditional cancer protein prediction systems rely on sequence data or omics features, often ignoring 3D structural alterations caused by mutations. With the availability of high-quality protein structures from AlphaFold, this project aims to exploit structural cues using modern deep learning techniques.

🏗 System Architecture

    The system consists of the following modules:
    Data Integration – OncoKB, UniProt, AlphaFold
    Preprocessing Engine – 3D to 2D biophysical encoding
    Dataset Management – Cancer vs Non-Cancer labeling
    Training Core – CNN ensemble training
    Visualization Layer – Grad-CAM and 3D protein viewer
    Deployment Layer – Streamlit web application

⚙ Methodology

    Collect cancer gene information from OncoKB and map them to UniProt identifiers.
    Download corresponding protein 3D structures from AlphaFold.
    Extract Cα atoms and confidence scores from .pdb files.
    Generate distance matrices, stability maps, and depth maps.
    Encode biophysical features into 299×299 RGB images.
    Train an ensemble of CNN models for binary classification.
    Perform inference with Grad-CAM explainability.

🧪 Preprocessing Pipeline

    Cα atom extraction from protein backbone
    Pairwise distance matrix computation
    B-factor (confidence) extraction
    Depth map calculation
    RGB channel encoding (Distance | Confidence | Depth)
    Padding and resizing to CNN-compatible format

🧠 Model Architecture

    The system uses an ensemble of three pretrained CNN models:
    DenseNet201 – Deep feature reuse and strong representation learning
    EfficientNet-B4 – Lightweight and computationally efficient
    SE-ResNet50 – Channel attention for enhanced feature importance

      Final predictions are obtained using ensemble averaging.

🏋 Training Strategy

    Train–Test Split: 80% / 20%
    Loss Function: Focal Loss
    Optimizer: Adam / AdamW
    Learning Rate Scheduler: Cosine Annealing
    Data Augmentation: Flips, rotations, normalization
    Class imbalance handled using weighted sampling

🔍 Visualization & Explainability

    Grad-CAM heatmaps highlight structurally important regions.
    3D protein viewer allows interactive inspection of structures.
    Model-wise probability distribution provides transparency.
